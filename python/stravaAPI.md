# The Strava API for newbies
Disclaimer: this is my own take on how to use the strava API and reflects my current understanding of it; for more information see [the official strava API documentation](https://developers.strava.com/docs/).

## The basic principle
Information is retrieved from the strava API by requesting a specific URL. In principle, you could get your user 

- they need to know which application is using the data (which application is making the request)
- they need the permission of the athlete to have their data accessed
